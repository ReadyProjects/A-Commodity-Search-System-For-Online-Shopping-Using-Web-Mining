Title: A Commodity Search System for Online Shopping Using Web Mining

Abstract:
With the exponential growth of online shopping platforms, the need for efficient and user-friendly commodity search systems has become paramount. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the online shopping experience through the integration of web mining techniques into a commodity search system. The primary objective is to empower users with a more effective and personalized search mechanism, thereby improving their ability to find desired products amidst the vast array of offerings on e-commerce websites.
The proposed system leverages web mining algorithms to extract valuable information from the vast amount of unstructured data available on online shopping websites. The mining process involves the extraction and analysis of product features, user reviews, and pricing information. This information is then organized and indexed to create a comprehensive database that forms the backbone of the search system.
